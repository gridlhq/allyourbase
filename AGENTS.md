## Go workflow rules
- After writing new .go files with new imports, run `go mod tidy` before `go test`
- When reading multiple independent files (e.g. impl files for a stage), read them all in parallel



never sign git commit messages as being from claude or anthropic

no quick fixes! no bandaids! always do the correct and professional DRY appraoch.  refactor as needed
