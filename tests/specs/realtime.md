**Story:** B-REAL-001
**Type:** Integration
**Fixture:** `tests/fixtures/realtime/subscribe-insert.json`

**Steps:**

3. Expect `event: connected` with `{message: "Connected to realtime"}`
4. Insert a new post record
5. Expect `event: change` with `{action: "INSERT", table: "posts", record: {...}}`

**Expected SSE Event:**
```
event: change
data: {"action":"INSERT","table":"posts","record":{"id":123,"title":"Test Post","author_id":456,"created_at":"2026-02-13T18:00:00Z"}}
```

**Assertions:**
- SSE connection established
- Received `connected` event
- Received `change` event after INSERT
- Event data contains `action: "INSERT"`
- Event data contains `table: "posts"`
- Event data contains full record with inserted values

---

### TC-REAL-002: Subscribe to Table — UPDATE Event

```

**Steps:**
1. Connect to `/api/realtime?tables=posts` with SSE
2. Update post with id=999
3. Expect `event: change` with `{action: "UPDATE", table: "posts", record: {...}}`

**Expected SSE Event:**
```
event: change
data: {"action":"UPDATE","table":"posts","record":{"id":999,"title":"Updated Title","author_id":1,"updated_at":"2026-02-13T18:01:00Z"}}
```

**Assertions:**

```

**Steps:**
1. Connect to `/api/realtime?tables=posts` with SSE
2. Delete post with id=888
3. Expect `event: change` with `{action: "DELETE", table: "posts", record: {id: 888}}`

**Expected SSE Event:**
```
event: change
data: {"action":"DELETE","table":"posts","record":{"id":888}}
```

**Assertions:**
- Received `change` event after DELETE
- Event data contains `action: "DELETE"`
- Record contains at least the `id` field

---

### TC-REAL-004: Subscribe to Multiple Tables

**Story:** B-REAL-001
**Type:** Integration
**Fixture:** `tests/fixtures/realtime/subscribe-multiple.json`

**Steps:**
1. Connect to `/api/realtime?tables=posts,comments` with SSE
2. Insert a post
3. Insert a comment
4. Expect 2 `change` events (one for posts, one for comments)

**Assertions:**
- Received change event for `table: "posts"`
- Received change event for `table: "comments"`
- Events arrive in correct order

---

### TC-REAL-005: RLS Filtering on Realtime Events

**Story:** B-REAL-001
**Type:** Integration
**Fixture:** `tests/fixtures/realtime/subscribe-rls.json`

**Setup:**
```sql
-- Enable RLS on posts table
ALTER TABLE posts ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Policy: users can only see their own posts
CREATE POLICY posts_select_own ON posts FOR SELECT USING (author_id = current_user_id());
```

**Steps:**
1. Register User A (id=100)
2. Register User B (id=200)
3. User A connects to `/api/realtime?tables=posts` with their token
4. Insert post by User A (author_id=100)
5. Insert post by User B (author_id=200)
6. Expect User A to receive ONLY the event for their own post

**Expected Behavior:**
- User A receives `change` event for post with author_id=100
- User A does NOT receive `change` event for post with author_id=200

**Assertions:**
- RLS policies enforced on realtime events
- User only sees events for authorized records

**Cleanup:**
```sql
DROP POLICY posts_select_own ON posts;
ALTER TABLE posts DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### TC-REAL-006: Realtime — Invalid Token

**Story:** B-REAL-001
**Type:** Integration

**Steps:**
1. Connect to `/api/realtime?tables=posts` with invalid/expired token
2. Expect 401 Unauthorized (connection rejected)

**Expected Response:**
- HTTP 401 status
- Error message: `"Invalid or expired token"`

**Assertions:**
- Connection is rejected
- No SSE events received
