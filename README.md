Open-source backend for PostgreSQL. Single binary. Auto-generated REST API, auth, realtime, storage, admin dashboard.

![AYB Local API Demo](assets/readme/demo.gif)

## Quickstart

Download the installer, then launch a demo app:

```bash
curl -fsSLo /tmp/ayb-install.sh https://install.allyourbase.io/install.sh
sh /tmp/ayb-install.sh
~/.ayb/bin/ayb start
~/.ayb/bin/ayb demo live-polls
```

Open http://localhost:5175 — you've got a real-time polling app with auth, RLS, SSE, and a REST API. No Docker. No config. The normal local server starts with auth disabled for open localhost development; `ayb demo` may restart its own AYB-managed local server with demo auth enabled.

The admin dashboard is at http://localhost:8090/admin — SQL editor, API explorer, schema browser, and user management for core workflows.

For database-owned search, the same collection list API supports full-text `search`, `fuzzy=true` typo tolerance with tunable typo-threshold, result highlighting, operator-defined synonyms, filters, and facet counts. Start with the [Search guide](https://allyourbase.io/guide/search); if you are moving query code from Algolia, use the [Algolia migration map](https://allyourbase.io/guide/migrating-from-algolia).

On first run, AYB downloads a prebuilt PostgreSQL binary for your platform and manages it as a child process — no system install required.

Current beta caveats, including managed PostgreSQL extension boundaries and passkey parity gaps, live in [Beta Limitations](https://allyourbase.io/guide/beta-limitations).

Three demos ship in [`/examples`](examples/):

- **[Live Polls](examples/live-polls/)** — Slido-lite — real-time polling with voting and bar charts
- **[Kanban Board](examples/kanban/)** — Trello-lite with drag-and-drop, auth, and realtime sync
- **[Movies](examples/movies/)** — Semantic movie search with notes, chat, and bring-your-own-key

New app scaffolds also include starter list-search examples that call `records.list` with `search` and `fuzzy`. The shipped non-vector search contract is documented in the [Search guide](https://allyourbase.io/guide/search).

## Who is this for?

- **Indie devs and small teams** who want a full backend without managing infrastructure. One binary, one command, done.
- **AI-first projects** building with Claude Code, Cursor, or Windsurf. The built-in MCP server gives AI tools direct access to your backend.
- **PocketBase graduates** who hit the SQLite ceiling and need Postgres — concurrent writes, RLS, extensions, horizontal scaling — without rewriting everything.

## Features

- **REST API** — CRUD for every table. Filter, sort, paginate, full-text `search`, `fuzzy=true`, result highlighting, operator-defined synonyms, scalar facets, FK expand. See the [Search guide](https://allyourbase.io/guide/search).
- **Auth** — email/password, JWT, OAuth (Google, GitHub, Microsoft, Apple, and more built-in providers), email verify, password reset
- **Realtime** — SSE subscriptions per table, filtered by RLS
- **Row-Level Security** — JWT claims mapped to Postgres session vars. Write policies in SQL.
- **Storage** — local disk or S3-compatible (R2, MinIO, DO Spaces, AWS)
- **Admin dashboard** — SQL editor, API explorer, schema browser, RLS manager, user management
- **RPC** — call Postgres functions via `POST /api/rpc/{function}`
- **Type generation** — `ayb types typescript` emits types from your schema
- **Embedded Postgres** — zero external dependencies for development
- **MCP server** — `ayb mcp` gives AI tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf) direct access to your schema, records, SQL, and RLS policies. See the [MCP Server guide](https://allyourbase.io/guide/mcp) for current tools, resources, and prompts.
13 tools, 2 resources, 3 prompts.

Your data lives in standard PostgreSQL. No lock-in — take your database and go.

## Working with the API

Create a table:

```bash
ayb sql "CREATE TABLE posts (
  id serial PRIMARY KEY,
  title text NOT NULL,
  body text,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
)"
```

Every table gets a full REST API automatically. For local development, AYB starts with auth disabled by default, so the API is open on `localhost`:

```bash
# Create
curl -X POST http://localhost:8090/api/collections/posts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "Hello world", "body": "First post"}'

# List (with sort, pagination)
curl 'http://localhost:8090/api/collections/posts?sort=-created_at&perPage=10'
```

Before exposing AYB beyond `localhost`, enable auth (`auth.enabled = true`) and rely on JWTs plus RLS policies for the routes you publish.

With auth enabled (`auth.enabled = true` in `ayb.toml`), include a JWT:

```bash
# Get a token
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8090/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"you@example.com","password":"yourpassword"}' | jq -r .token)

# Use it
curl -X POST http://localhost:8090/api/collections/posts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"title": "Hello world", "body": "First post"}'
```

```bash
# Admin dashboard
open http://localhost:8090/admin
```

Every table gets CRUD, filtering, sorting, pagination, full-text search, fuzzy matching when `pg_trgm` is available, result highlighting, operator-defined synonyms, scalar facets, and FK expansion through the collection list endpoint. The [Search guide](https://allyourbase.io/guide/search) owns examples and boundaries.

## SDK

```bash
npm install @allyourbase/js
```

```typescript
import { AYBClient } from "@allyourbase/js";
const ayb = new AYBClient("http://localhost:8090");

// Records
const { items } = await ayb.records.list("posts", {
  filter: "published=true",
  sort: "-created_at",
  expand: "author",
});
await ayb.records.create("posts", { title: "New post" });

// Auth
await ayb.auth.login("user@example.com", "password");

// Realtime
ayb.realtime.subscribe(["posts"], (e) => {
  console.log(e.action, e.record);
});
```

## Existing database

Point at any Postgres instance. Existing tables become API endpoints on startup.

```bash
ayb start --database-url postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/mydb
```

## Config

Zero config by default. Customize via `ayb.toml`, env vars (`AYB_` prefix), or CLI flags.

```toml
[server]
port = 8090

[database]
url = "postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/mydb"

[auth]
enabled = true

[storage]
backend = "s3"
```

Precedence: defaults → `ayb.toml` → env vars → CLI flags. Check resolved config: `ayb config`.

## CLI

```
ayb start                Start server (embedded or external Postgres)
ayb sql "..."            Execute SQL
ayb schema [table]       Inspect database schema
ayb migrate up           Apply pending migrations
ayb migrate create       Create a new migration
ayb admin reset-password Reset admin password
ayb apikeys create       Create an API key
ayb types typescript     Generate TypeScript types
ayb mcp                  Start MCP server for AI tools
```

Run `ayb --help` or `ayb <command> --help` for the full command list.
32 commands total.

## Migrate from PocketBase, Supabase, or Algolia

Current support:

- PocketBase import path is hardened and regression-covered.
- Supabase local CLI, hosted cloud, and self-hosted import paths have scripted live-validation evidence in-repo.
- Algolia query-code migrations are documented against AYB's shipped list-search API, while data moves through standard PostgreSQL ingest paths.
- Firebase live-export validation remains deferred and is not part of the public README migration promise.

For Algolia query-code migration, see the [Algolia migration guide](https://allyourbase.io/guide/migrating-from-algolia). It maps Algolia concepts to AYB's `search`, `fuzzy`, `filter`, `facets`, result highlighting, typo-threshold controls, and operator-defined synonyms request path. See [Beta Limitations](https://allyourbase.io/guide/beta-limitations) for migration caveats that are intentionally bounded in the beta.

Fastest path (single CLI command into managed AYB Postgres):

```bash
# PocketBase (source is pb_data directory)
ayb start --from ./pb_data

# Supabase (source is direct Postgres URL; use port 5432, not pooler 6543)
ayb start --from "postgresql://postgres:<password>@db.<ref>.supabase.co:5432/postgres"
```

If you want explicit control over target DB and options, use standalone commands:

```bash
# PocketBase -> specific target DB
ayb migrate pocketbase \
  --source ./pb_data \
  --database-url "postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/mydb" \
  -y

# Supabase -> specific target DB
ayb migrate supabase \
  --source-url "postgresql://postgres:<password>@db.<ref>.supabase.co:5432/postgres" \
  --database-url "postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/mydb" \
  -y
```

Supabase storage files: include `--storage-export <dir>` only if you have an exported storage directory to migrate.
