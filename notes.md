plan here is to push to prod and post on hn and reddit.  pausing on /Users/stuart/repos/allyourbase_root/allyourbase_dev/.mike/SIGIL_NINE_FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST-96c8e1

2 items left.  then resuming there after hn, reddit posts are up.  

and being careful then to work on dev branches after.  and just to staging i guess
